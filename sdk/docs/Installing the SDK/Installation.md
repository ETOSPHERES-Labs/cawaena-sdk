# Installation

For installing the SDK, follow the steps detailed for each ecosystem. Currently the SDK only supports the following languages/stacks:

- [Java](./Java.md)
- [Swift (for iOS)](Swift.md)
- [JavaScript / TypeScript](./JS_TS.md)

Further support for other languages & ecosystems can be requested to the SDK team by contacting the maintainers of this document or reaching out directly to us @ ETO GRUPPE TECHNOLOGIES GmbH.
