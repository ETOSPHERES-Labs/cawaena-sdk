## [v0.10.4]

- Added `get_wallet_transaction_list` - Returns the list of transactions of wallet by taking page and page size as a parameter.

## [v0.10.0]

- Pagination of `getTxList` now works correctly.
- The functions `setCurrency` (introduced in v0.9.0), `getSwapList` and `getSwapDetails` (introduced in v0.8.2) had issues with the binding due to naming and could not be called from android, that has now been fixed and the functions are callable as intended.
- Added a check so that a transaction cannot be committed until it is marked as ‚ÄúValid‚Äù by the backend. This partially fixes the issue with being able to give more compliments than the daily limit.

## [v0.9.0]

- Added new function `setCurrency`. From this version, this method will handle(setNodeUrl, setCoinType, setBech32Hrp) operations. For this reason those methods have been removed.
- Added new function `deleteUser. This method will allow a user to request to delete all of his data.

## [v0.8.0]

- Added `getSwapList`. Retrieves the list of all the swaps(viviswap orders) performed by a user
- Added `getSwapDetails`. Retrieves details for a specific swap(order in viviswap)

## [v0.7.3]

- Updated `get_iban` function. It now gives is_verified flag to show if the IBAN is verified by viviswap or not.
- The `createPurchaseRequest` function now requires the string literal "CLIK" as the string value in parameter `purchase_type` for compliments instead of "COMPLIMENT".
- Improved balance function internally to find hidden balances.

## [v0.7.1]

- Viviswap onboarding stabilized

## [v0.7.0]

- Added new function `updateCustomer` which updates or creates a new customer account for billing. It requires the two-character
 country code of the user, which can be the same as the one used while doing a new user registration. Calling this function is mandatory before initializing wallet. The list of valid/legally allowed country codes will be given to the team before go-live.
- Modified the function createPurchaseRequest. It now requires three more parameters: `product_hash`, `app_data` (may be empty but can be used to store additional data of the image like thumbnail URL etc‚Ä¶), `purchase_type` (Required currently and should be set to the constant value ‚ÄúCOMPLIMENT‚Äù)
- `getBalance` is now modified internally. It performs claiming of dust outputs, so that micro-transactions and locked outputs do not get lost. if not claimed. This feature is only internal to the crypto-currency and has no impact on the UX/UI.
- QA and staging environment now use SMR mainnet. Getting tokens now happens via either purchase from viviswap or transfer of existing SMR from own wallet-
- Webhook notifications can now be encrypted.

## [v0.6.4]

- Added new function `getTxList` which gives list of purchases and supports pagination. It gives the transaction list of all the transaction sent and received. If the value of the ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù is same as the username, the transaction was received, if different, then the transaction was sent.

## [v0.6.3]

- Added `createViviswapDetail` function needed to perform withdrawals. It does not take any parameters.
- Modified `createWithdrawalWithViviswap` to now accept pin. If a pin is given, it tries to automatically perform withdrawal and also provides details for withdrawal. If no pin is given, it will just create a detail (address and an id) for manual withdrawal.
- Fixed issues with deposit and withdrawal at viviswap

## [v0.6.0]

- Added two new configuration settings `setCoinType` and `setBech32Hrp` which are now mandatory.
